    <h5>Evaluation of Matthew's Diagrams</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Signifier -- hovering over each state shows outline/indicates that micro page exists</li>
      <li>Mapping -- map of US to indicate states</li>
      <li>Comfort -- bad because each graph takes up a lot of space and is on their own line.</li>
      <li>Understandability -- The design is very simplistic with only a few visual graphs and minimal text. This makes it easy for anyone to understand. The order of the graphs goes from the largest idea (map of US) to smaller ideas (individual causes of deaths).</li>
      <li>Achievability -- only a few graphs, all possible with plotly library. Not too much that it would take too long either. The CSS is pretty simple as well.</li>

    <h5>Evaluation of Ben's Diagrams</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Signifier — hovering over each state shows top-level data and indicates that a micro view exists</li>
      <li>Mapping — Map of US shows states and provides a familiar indication of where to click</li>
      <li>Discoverability — Buttons/features are not hidden behind a lot of menus, making it very easy to figure out the program's capabilities</li>
      <li>Achievability — Not making very many graphs or performing complicated data analysis will make this managable. Getting data by hovering might make for a challenge</li>
      <li>Understandability — The design isn't overly complicated or technical and it is fairly intuitive, so it should be very easy to extract data and useful information from</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Settled Design</h2>
    <p>We settled on a design similar to Ben's for the macro page. We decided that Ben's diagram was better because it was more simplistic and more effectively communicated the data through its graphs. However, we decided to include the feature, where the user could hover over each state and get some basic information, from Matthew's diagram. For the micro page, we have decided to use Ben's diagram again for similar reasons, but chose to include Matthew's feature that showed the total deaths and populations at the top of the micro page.<p>
